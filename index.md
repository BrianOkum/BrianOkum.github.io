## Portfolio

### Standard Operating Procedures
Process documentation ensuring consistent, efficient manufacturing operations. Step-by-step guides that maintain quality, reduce errors, and may double as training material.

- I write [longform SOPs](https://brianokum.github.io/SOP-longform.pdf) several hundred pages long using text supported by multiple media formats to provide operators with detailed instructions for the most complex tasks.

- I also write shortform SOPs that rely primarily on one mode of instruction (e.g. [photography](x) or [text-based](x)) for simplicity and efficiency.

- [Process flows](process-flow.png) give production teams a bird's eye view of manufacturing.
  
- The integration of [CAD in assambly documentation](dwg-bom.png) produces clear instructions, is an efficient media method for technical writers, and brings the engineering one step closer to production team members.

### Quality Control Documentation
Documentation that supports quality control and compliance for single unit to thousand unit runs

- Printed or electronically kept [batch manufacturing records (BMRs)](https://brianokum.github.io/BMR-template.pdf) can support high and low-volume production runs alike

- [Electronic travelers](trv-screenshot.png) are a good method to track the assembly and QC lifecycle in a "low-volume high-cost" production environement.
