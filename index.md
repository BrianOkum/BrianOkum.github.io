## What I Do:
I create clear technical documentation for innovative manufacturers, both for internal teams and external audiences. 


Good technical documentation bridges communication gaps. Whether translating engineering specifications or scientific processes into actionable steps for production staff, ensuring quality and manufacturing teams speak the same language, or giving consumers what they need to understand the product and nothing more, my goal is ultimately to make complex information usable. 


As a freelance contractor and consultant, I work directly with you to identify your documentation needs and deliver practical solutions.

### Standard Operating Procedures
Process documentation ensuring consistent, efficient manufacturing operations. Step-by-step guides that maintain quality, reduce errors, and may double as training material.

- I write [longform SOPs](https://brianokum.github.io/SOP-longform.pdf) that may be hundreds of pages long. These utilize text-based instructions and multiple media formats to guide internal staff through complex assembly and quality steps.

- I also write shortform SOPs that rely primarily on one instructional mode (e.g. [photography](SOP_imagebased.pdf) or [text-based](x)) for simplicity and efficiency. These work well for simple procedures.

- Beyond core instructions, I develop supplementary elements that bring value. [Process flows](process-flow.png) give production teams a bird's eye view of the manufacturing process. The integration of [CAD in assembly documentation](dwg-bom.png) is often visually clearer for operators and time-efficient for technical writers than process photography. Simplifying engineering schematics into lay-friendly diagrams (like this [wiring diagram](diagram_userfriendly.png)) is another way in which the engineering domain of a company can be better integrated with production teams or end-user documentation.

### Quality Control Documentation
Effective QC documentation is developed alongside standard operating procedures to ensure consistency.

- Printed or electronically maintained [batch manufacturing records (BMRs)](https://brianokum.github.io/BMR-template.pdf) support high and low-volume production runs alike.

- [Electronic travelers](trv-screenshot.png) effectively track the assembly and QC lifecycle in a low-volume, high-cost production environement.
